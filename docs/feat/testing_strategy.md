# Testing Strategy for Audapolis Whisper Migration

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for all three phases of the Audapolis modernization project.

## Testing Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
- **Test-Driven Integration**: Each step should be testable independently
- **Regression Prevention**: Existing functionality must never break
- **Performance Validation**: All optimizations must be measurably better
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests based on actual user workflows
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple tests first, complex integration tests last

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Tests
Test individual components in isolation.

### 2. Integration Tests  
Test component interactions and data flow.

### 3. System Tests
Test complete workflows end-to-end.

### 4. Performance Tests
Validate speed, accuracy, and resource usage improvements.

### 5. Regression Tests
Ensure existing functionality continues working.
