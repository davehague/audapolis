`audapolis` aims to make the workflow for spoken-word-heavy media editing easier, faster and more accessible.

- It gives you a **wordprocessor-like experience** for media editing.
- It can **automatically transcribe** your audio to text.
- It can be used for **Video, Audio** and mixed editing - Do radio shows, podcasts, audiobooks, interview clips or anything you like.

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- **Python 3.8-3.10** (3.11+ not supported due to dependency constraints)
- **Poetry** for Python dependency management
- **Git**

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bugbakery/audapolis.git
   cd audapolis
   ```

2. **Set up Node.js**
   ```bash
   nvm install 20  # or latest stable
   nvm use 20
   ```

3. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   # Install Python 3.10 if not available
   pyenv install 3.10.18  # or use your Python manager
   pyenv local 3.10.18
   
   # Install Poetry
   pip install poetry
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Frontend dependencies
   cd app
   npm install
   
   # Backend dependencies
   cd ../server
   poetry install
   ```

5. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   # Build the app
   cd ../app
   npm run build
   
   # Start development server
   npm start
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

audapolis consists of two main components:

- **Frontend**: Electron app with React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI server with Vosk for transcription

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- Electron 32+ for desktop app framework
- React 17 with TypeScript
- Vite 6 for build tooling and development
- Styled Components for styling

**Backend:**
- Python 3.8-3.10
- FastAPI for the web API
- Vosk for speech recognition
- pydiar for speaker diarization
- pydub for audio processing

## üìù Development Workflow

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd app

# Start development server with hot reload
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Lint and format
npm run check
npm run fmt

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Backend Development

```bash
cd server

# Start server manually (usually auto-started by frontend)
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Run linting
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .
poetry run flake8 .

# Install new dependencies
poetry add package-name
```

## üîß Available Scripts

### Frontend (`app/`)

- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run dist` - Build distributable packages
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run check` - Run TypeScript and ESLint checks
- `npm run fmt` - Format code with Prettier

### Backend (`server/`)

- `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload` - Start development server
- `poetry install` - Install dependencies
- `poetry add <package>` - Add new dependency

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- **Video export** is disabled on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) due to build issues with OpenTimelineIO
- **Python 3.8-3.10 required** (3.11+ not supported due to dependency constraints)

## üì¶ Building Releases

```bash
cd app
npm run dist
```

This creates distributable packages in the `dist/` directory.
