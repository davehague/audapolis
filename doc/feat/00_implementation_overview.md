# Audapolis Whisper Migration: Implementation Overview

## Project Structure

This implementation is broken down into three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core Whisper Integration** - Replace Vosk with OpenAI Whisper
2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Diarization** - Replace PyDiar with Pyannote 3.1  
3. **Phase 3: Performance Optimization** - Add GPU acceleration and advanced features

Each phase is further broken down into small, iterative steps that build on each other.

## Implementation Principles

- **Incremental Progress**: Each step produces working, testable code
- **No Big Jumps**: Complexity increases gradually
- **Integration First**: No orphaned code - everything connects to existing system
- **Backward Compatible**: Maintain existing API structure during transition
- **Safety First**: Each step can be reverted without breaking the system

```

## Step Sizing Philosophy

Each step is designed to be:
- **Small enough**: 1-2 hours of focused implementation
- **Large enough**: Meaningful progress toward the goal
- **Self-contained**: Can be completed and tested independently
- **Building**: Uses code from previous steps without modification

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

- Python 3.8-3.11 (current constraint)
- PyTorch with CUDA support (for GPU acceleration)
- FastAPI backend (existing)
- Electron/React frontend (existing)

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1**: Vosk fully replaced by Whisper transcription with same API
- **Phase 2**: Speaker diarization significantly improved
- **Phase 3**: GPU acceleration and real-time capabilities

Each phase maintains full functionality while adding new capabilities.
