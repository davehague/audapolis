# Phase 2: Enhanced Diarization (Continued)

### Step 2.5: Create Diarization Bridge Layer

**Context**: Create unified interface supporting both PyDiar and Pyannote with intelligent fallbacks.

**Prompt 2.5**:
```
You are implementing Step 2.5 of Phase 2 for the Audapolis Whisper migration project.

Current Context:
- Step 2.4 created advanced PyannoteDiarizer with overlapping speech detection
- Existing PyDiar system still needs to work for fallback scenarios
- Need unified interface similar to TranscriptionEngine from Phase 1
- Should handle authentication failures, model unavailability, etc.

Task: Create diarization bridge layer

Requirements:
1. Create server/app/diarization_bridge.py with DiarizationEngine class
2. Implement unified diarize() method that:
   - Detects available diarization engines (Pyannote vs PyDiar)
   - Routes to appropriate engine based on configuration and availability
   - Returns consistent output format
   - Handles errors gracefully with fallbacks
3. Add diarization engine preference system (auto, pyannote, pydiar)
4. Implement smart fallback logic:
   - If Pyannote fails (auth, model, memory), fallback to PyDiar
   - If advanced features requested but unavailable, degrade gracefully
   - Handle HuggingFace authentication failures
5. Maintain exact same interface as existing BinaryKeyDiarizationModel.diarize()

Files to create:
- server/app/diarization_bridge.py

Expected Output:
- DiarizationEngine class with unified diarize() method

4. Implement quality improvement features:
   - Remove very short speaker segments (likely errors)
   - Merge consecutive segments from same speaker
   - Add confidence scoring for speaker assignments
5. Add post-processing options:
   - Minimum segment duration
