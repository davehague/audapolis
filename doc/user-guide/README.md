## Key Concepts

**Time-Synchronized Editing**: Unlike traditional audio editors, Audapolis lets you edit by working with the transcribed text. When you cut, copy, or rearrange text, the corresponding audio moves with it.

**Speaker Diarization**: Automatically identify and separate different speakers in your audio, making it easier to edit multi-person conversations, interviews, and meetings.

**Non-Destructive Editing**: Your original audio files are never modified. Audapolis stores all edits in project files, so you can always go back to the original.

**Local Processing**: Everything runs on your computer - no cloud uploads, no internet required for transcription (after downloading models).
